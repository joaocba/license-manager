# License Manager Dashboard

This project, developed as part of my internship for the Citeforma .NET developer course certification, is a License Manager Dashboard. It enables clients to manage licenses for a proprietary ERP software web application. The dashboard supports role-based access for clients, regular users, and technical administrators, each with tailored features to streamline license management, billing, and platform administration.

### Important notice:
This is part of a larger ERP software web application. The code provided here represents the similar components code I was directly involved in developing during my internship. **Please note that the available files do not represent the real and final runnable application code** as this repository contains only the code specific to my contributions.
